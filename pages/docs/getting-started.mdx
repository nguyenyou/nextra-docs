# Getting Started

## Installation

Inside your React project directory, run the following:

```plaintext
yarn add swr
```

Or with npm:

```plaintext
npm install swr
```

## Quick Start

For normal RESTful APIs with JSON data, first you need to create a `fetcher` function, which is just a wrapper of the native `fetch`:

```jsx
const fetcher = (...args) => fetch(...args).then((res) => res.json())
```
